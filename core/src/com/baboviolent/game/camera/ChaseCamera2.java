/**
 * A Camera that tends to chase an object in a natural way
 * 
 * Basically it consists of three parts:
 * 
 * - The object: a world transformation matrix (translation and rotation) of the object to follow, you could use your
 * render matrix for this.
 * 
 * - The target position: the location and offset (explained below) to look at relative to the object to follow.
 * so if you want to look slight above or ahead the object just set the target,
 * to look directly at the object leave them zero.
 * 
 * - The desired position: the desired location and offset (explained below) of the camera relative to the object to follow.
 * so if you want your camera always behind or above your object just the desired location and offset.
 * 
 * For the target position and desired position there's a location and offset. Both are relative to the object.
 * The difference is that the location is rotated with the object, while the offset is not. So i.e. to keep the cam
 * always above the object even if the object is up side down, you set the offset. To keep the cam always facing the back
 * of the object, you set the location.
 * 
 * There are three operating modes. 
 * - The first being a tail camera, set the rotationSpeed to a negative value for this.
 * In this mode the cam is always in line of the desired position and the object. As if it was attached fixed at the object.
 * 
 * - The second mode is the follow camera, set the rotationSpeed to zero for this. In this mode the cam will not move to
 * the desired location, it just maintains distance. As if it was attached with a rope to the object.
 * 
 * - The third mode is the interpolated of these two, set the rotationSpeed to a positive value for this this.
 * In this mode the cam will follow to maintain distance and rotate to get to the desired position.
 * 
 * TODO: The acceleration (and speed) are to be futher implemented to give a more smooth follow of the object.
